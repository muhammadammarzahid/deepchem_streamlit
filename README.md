# DeepChem Streamlit app

This app takes the structure of compounds in SMILES format and predicts whether the compound is a substrate or inhibitor of the five Cytochrome-P450 enzymes.

The predictions are based on Graph Convolutional Neural Network models. 

The models were trained and validated using the structure and activity data of the substarates and inhibitors of enzymes.

The models are saved in "models" folder.
